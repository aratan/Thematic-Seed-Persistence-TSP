# **Thematic Seed Persistence in Large Language Models: Enhancing Response Consistency through Contextual Seeding**

---

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for generating human-like text responses across a vast range of topics. However, generating consistent responses for similar queries across distinct interactions remains a challenge. We introduce **Thematic Seed Persistence (TSP)**, a technique designed to enhance response consistency by mapping predefined seeds to specific topics or thematic areas. By associating a unique random seed to each thematic category, TSP enables LLMs to produce repeatable, coherent responses in applications requiring reliability across similar queries. We evaluate TSP in various domains, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves response consistency and user satisfaction.

## 1. Introduction

LLMs, such as GPT and others, are increasingly deployed in applications requiring reliable, consistent responses, especially for topic-specific queries. Although these models can generate diverse outputs, this inherent variability can lead to inconsistencies when users seek uniform responses across related queries. Traditional approaches like fine-tuning can partially address this, but they are computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose **Thematic Seed Persistence (TSP)**, a lightweight technique that leverages fixed random seeds associated with thematic areas to enforce consistency in generated responses.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Overview of Thematic Seed Persistence

Thematic Seed Persistence (TSP) is based on the idea of associating each thematic area with a unique random seed. When the LLM is prompted to generate a response for a specific topic, TSP retrieves and applies the seed associated with that topic, thereby initializing the LLM’s random generation process in a predictable way. By fixing seeds for predefined themes, TSP reduces output variability and enhances response consistency.

### 2.2 Technical Implementation

TSP is implemented in three main steps:

1. **Seed Storage**: We maintain a configuration file (`seeds_config.json`) that maps each thematic category to a unique seed. This file is updated as new thematic areas are identified.

2. **Seed Retrieval**: When a query is submitted to the LLM, TSP checks if the topic has an associated seed. If found, the seed is loaded; otherwise, a new seed may be generated and stored if the topic requires persistence.

3. **Response Generation**: The LLM is initialized with the retrieved seed, and the prompt is passed to the model to generate a response. This setup ensures that responses for identical or similar prompts are consistent across sessions.
